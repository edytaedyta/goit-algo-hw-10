Conclusions on the Correctness of Calculations

Comparison of Analytical and Numerical Methods:

The integral of the function f(x)=x2f(x) = x^2f(x)=x2 over the interval from 0 to 2 was calculated using two methods: the analytical method (via the spi.quad function) and the Monte Carlo simulation.
The result obtained analytically using the spi.quad function is 2.6667.

Monte Carlo Method Accuracy:
The Monte Carlo simulation, which involved generating random points and estimating the area under the curve, also yielded an average result of 2.6667 after 100 experiments.

Consistency of Results:
The close match between the results obtained using the Monte Carlo method and the analytical calculation (both yielding 2.6667) indicates the correctness of the calculations.
This consistency confirms that the Monte Carlo method is a reliable numerical technique for estimating the area under the curve.

Verification and Validation:
The analytical result serves as a benchmark for validating the accuracy of the Monte Carlo simulation.
The agreement between the two methods verifies that the Monte Carlo approach correctly estimates the integral of the function f(x)=x2f(x) = x^2f(x)=x2 over the specified interval.

Implications for Numerical Methods:
The findings demonstrate that numerical methods like the Monte Carlo simulation can provide accurate estimates for integrals, especially when validated against analytical solutions.
This validation process is crucial for ensuring the reliability of numerical techniques in practical applications where analytical solutions might not be feasible.

In conclusion, the correctness of the calculations is confirmed by the agreement between the results obtained from the Monte Carlo simulation and the analytical integration using the spi.quad function. This consistency reinforces the accuracy and reliability of both methods.
